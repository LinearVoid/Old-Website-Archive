# Personal-Website-Old

This is my old Personal Website. I am currently reworking it, but I thought that having the older version would be nice to compare too. This is the very first foray into making a website. Be warned the code is very messy. 
When I made this, I used pure CSS and HTML. Since then I have learned NodeJS and Bootstrap. I plan to remake this using React or another similar framework like Vue.JS
